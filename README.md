## 🚧 Project

One of the main pain point that AT&T users are facing is constant exposure to SPAM messages.

AT&T has been able to manually flag spam messages for a time, but they are looking for an automated way of detecting spams to protect their users.

## 🎯 Goals

Your goal is to build a spam detector, that can automatically flag spams as they come based solely on the sms' content.

## 🦮 Helpers 

To help you achieve this project, here are a few tips that should help you:

### Start simple
A good deep learing model does not necessarily have to be super complicated!

### Transfer learning
You do not have access to a whole lot of data, perhaps channeling the power of a more sophisticated model trained on billions of observations might help!

## 📬 Deliverable

To complete this project, your team should:

Write a notebook that runs preprocessing and trains one or more deep learning models in order to predict the spam or ham nature of the sms
State the achieved performance clearly
